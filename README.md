# Project_Hangman
A python text game

Hi, this is a simple python text game that stores a word and asks you to guess its letters. 
You win if all letters are guessed correctly. 
You lose if your correct guesses are not up to the number of letters the word is made with. 
Ohhh! remember, each time you guess wrongly, an extra feature of Hangman is printed.....know that you are on your way to hang the man...Anyways! Let's dive in.
